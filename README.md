An R implementation of various extensions to the CRAN sigclust package.
Currently, the package only includes a non-working form of HSigClust with
the intention of expanding the package to also include KSigClust functionality.

A short to-do list for th near future:
 * clean up plot.hsigclust, diagnostics.hsigclust
 * translate KSCtest from Matlab to R
 * complete vignette
