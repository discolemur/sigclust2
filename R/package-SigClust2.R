#' Statistical Significance for Clustering
#'
#' This package implements statistical significance of clustering procedures
#' based on the assumption that a cluster may be well approximated as a
#' single Gaussian distribution. The procedure is particularly well-suited for
#' the high-dimension low-sample size setting when the number of dimensions
#' greatly outnumbers the number of observations. The package builds substantially
#' on the \code{sigclust} package currently available through CRAN to include
#' additional options for null Gaussian estimation based on scaled PCA scores, and
#' more substantially, to test for significance in hierarchical clustering.
